# Learning Center Analytics Project

<h2>Summary </h2>
- Executed a quasi-experiment to investigate the effectiveness of three potential new educational programs at the learning center, analyzing an 18K student grade dataset with R.
<br />
<br />
- Applied linear regression to statistically compare the performance across different student groups to identify the improvement brought by new educational programs.
<br />
<br />
- Visualized the student grade comparisons by Tableau; compiled an analysis report with insights and recommendations, resulting in a <b>threefold improvement</b> in student scores compared to the original program.

<h2>Description</h2>
Cobblestone Learning Center (CLC) provides tutoring services and test preparation for students in grades 7-12. This project aimed to leverage data analytics to enhance service delivery and inform strategic business decisions at CLC.
<br />
<br />
The Curriculum Review Committee initiated a test market experiment by implementing three new educational programs across selected districts. Each program was exclusively used for a cohort of incoming students to evaluate its effectiveness.
<br />
<br />
My role was to analyze the experimental data, synthesize the findings, and recommend the most effective educational program for broader adoption based on measured outcomes and strategic alignment with CLCâ€™s goals.
